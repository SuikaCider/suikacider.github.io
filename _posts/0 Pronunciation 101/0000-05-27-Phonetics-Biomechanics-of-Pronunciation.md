Everything I'm about to tell you builds off of a simple fact: sound is an inherently physical phenomenon.

Just as [blowing into a nearly-full bottle will result in a high-pitched whistle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl4zGRSYqkE), every single sound you make is the result of air escaping your mouth (and/or nose) in a specific way. This in mind, we could say that sounds have "recipes": just as a cake is (basically) the result of flour, sugar, and eggs, a T sound is (basically) the result of placing your tongue in a specific place and expelling air from your mouth without letting your vocal chords vibrate.

In the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) (IPA), the official "recipe" for /t/ is "voiceless alveolar plosive". You don't need to know what means right now. I just want you to understand two things:

1. Each sound can be broken down into a series of concrete movements/actions within your speech organ
2. Recipes are somewhat open to interpretation: just as one chef might use more or less sugar for their signature cake, the standard French /t/ sound isn't quite the same as the standard English /t/ sound

This in mind, in each of my pronunciation guides, I am basically contrasting English's IPA with another language's IPA for you.

Talking about sounds in this way might seem weird at first, but doing so comes with three major benefits:

1. Each sound in the IPA is associated with a specific name and symbol — there's no funny business like GH sounding one way in *tough*, another in *ghost*, and another still in *neighbor*.
2. IPA symbols are consistent across languages — there's no funny business like English's C sounding like K or S while Pinyin's C sounding like "ts"
3. Each IPA symbol's name is a concrete "recipe" that will tell you (almost) step-by-step how to pronounce a given sound

That out of the way:
