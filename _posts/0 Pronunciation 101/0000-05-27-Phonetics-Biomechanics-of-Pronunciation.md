> *There's a lot of information on this page. You do not need to memorize any of it to read my pronunciation guides. Each page of the main document has been written assuming that you don't know anything about phonetics beyond what I explicitly tell you. As such—skim and explore, but don't fret!*
 {: .prompt-info }

Everything I'm about to tell you builds off of a simple fact: sound is an inherently physical phenomenon.

Just as [blowing into a nearly-full bottle will result in a high-pitched whistle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl4zGRSYqkE), every single sound you make is the result of air escaping your mouth (and/or nose) in a specific way. This in mind, we could say that sounds have "recipes": just as a cake is (basically) the result of flour, sugar, and eggs, a T sound is (basically) the result of placing your tongue in a specific place and expelling air from your mouth without letting your vocal chords vibrate.

In the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) (IPA), the official "recipe" for /t/ is "voiceless alveolar plosive". You don't need to know what that means right now. I just want you to understand two things:

1. Each sound can be broken down into a series of concrete movements/actions within your speech organ
2. Recipes are somewhat open to interpretation: just as one chef might use more or less sugar for their signature cake, one language's /t/ sound might not be quite the same as another language's /t/ sound

This in mind, in each of my pronunciation guides, I am basically contrasting English's IPA with another language's IPA for you — talking about the similarities and differences between our "recipes".

Talking about sounds in this way might seem weird at first, but doing so comes with three major benefits:

1. **Consistency within languages**: Each sound in the IPA is associated with a specific name and symbol — there's no funny business like GH sounding one way in *tough*, another in *ghost*, and another still in *neighbor*.
2. **Consistency between languages**: IPA symbols are quite consistent across languages — there's no funny business like English's C sounding like K or S but Pinyin's C sounding like TS
3. **Clarity of instruction**: Each IPA symbol's name is a concrete "recipe" that will tell you (almost) step-by-step how to pronounce a given sound

That out of the way:

## The "recipes" of consonants
Now that the scene is set, we're ready to talk about consonants. Whether you're speaking Cantonese or Klingon, every consonant boils down to the same three basic things:

1. **Place of articulation** → loosely speaking, which part of your mouth connects with or approaches which part of your mouth
2. **Manner of articulation** → what happens to air as it leaves your mouth
3. **Voicing** → place your fingers (lightly) on your neck, then say *shhhh* and *zhhhh* out loud

### [Element 1] Place of articulation
*If you prefer watching, check out [this 6min video by Artifexian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMEFr7ghMTg).*

The first "element" or "ingredient" of our recipe is what's called a *place of articulation*: to make any sound, you manipulate airflow at a specific **place** in your speech organ (mouth, nose, ~throat). For example, the sound /t/ involves connecting the tip of your tongue to your alveolar ridge (the red bump on the below image).

You can think of your mouth as being like the glass bottle we discussed in the introduction. When you use a particular *place of articulation*, you are establishing a specific "shape" for your mouth by causing air to be constricted in a specific place. Just as changing the water:air ratio in a glass bottle affects the resulting pitch when you blow into it, the sound that comes out of your mouth depends in large part on where, exactly, you constrict the air escaping it.

Please take a moment to look at the below image and explore your mouth a bit. You don't need to memorize any of this; I will walk through it later on, introducing the key places of articulation as they become relevant.

Say the following words very slowly, paying attention to where you "feel" the beginning of each word:
* The /p/ in *pan*
* The /t/ in *tan*
* The /ʃ/ (ch) in *chandelier*
* The /k/ (c) in *can*
* The /h/ in *hand*

### [Element 2] Manner of Articulation
*If you prefer watching, check out [this 5min video by Artifexian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3IO5K5ZGB4).*

While the place of articulation determines where airflow is manipulated in your speech organ, the *manner of articulation* determines *how* that airflow is manipulated. You've already mastered all of these manners of manipulating air, so now let's give them names:

(Again, we'll explore all of these things in detail later, when they become relevant, so no need to memorize. Simply explore a bit and try to consciously notice what's happening inside your mouth.)

* **Plosives** — Two-part sounds in which you first block the flow of air and then let it "explode" out. Examples include the /p/ in *pop* or the /k/ in *king*. Note that these sounds are instantaneous; the air explodes out and that's that.
* **Fricatives** — "buzzing" or "hissing" sounds in which you bring two articulators (parts of your mouth/etc) near each other, without quite touching, causing turbulence in the air escaping your mouth. Examples include the /z/ in *zoom* and the /f/ in *off*. Note that, if you want, you can sustain these sounds indefinitely: *shhhhhhhhhh*.
* **Affricates** — Sounds that start off as plosives but then transition into being a fricative. Examples include the /tʃ/ (ch) in *cheese* or the /dʒ/ in *joy*. As these sounds end in a fricative, you can sustian them indefinitely: *chhhhhhhhhhhhheese!*
* **Nasals** — Sounds in which air comes out of your mouth and nose simultaneously. Place your fingers lightly on the outside of your nostrils and then say *had* and *hand*. Again, you can sustain these sounds indefinitely: *Mmmmmmmmmm! Looks good!*
* **Flaps/Trills** — Flaps are like very fast plosives — one articulator taps another very lightly and quickly. This often happens to T sounds in the middle of words: *butter* becomes *budder*. Trills, on the other hand, are a string of flaps in quick succession — when you blow a raspberry, you are actually making a "bilabial (two-lip) trill"!
* **Vowels** — Vowels are not a manner of articulation, but you might think of them as being the *lack* of one. Because you don't "manipulate" the sound as you do in the above way with vowels, they result in clean sounds (no turbulence as with fricatives) that can be sustained indefinitely. Furthermore, this relative inner-mouth freedom means that you can "bend" vowels in a very clean fashion! Say *Ahhhhhhhh-eeeeeeeehhhh--ooooooohhhh* with one continuous breath.
* **Liquids/Rhotics** — Loosely speaking, L and R sounds. These sounds are special in that they fall somewhat "between" a vowel and consonant, but are closer to consonants. This flexible nature lets them add "color" to the consonant or vowel they precede. Say *ahhhh*, and notice how the vowel quality shifts a bit when you then slowly say *are* or *all*. Note that English has a quite unique R sound, and this causes trouble for both people learning English (it's a new sound) and for English speakers learning other languages (the R they're used to likely doesn't exist in the target language!)
* **Semivowels/Glides** — Loosely speaking, W and Y sounds. These sounds are like vowels, but shorter, and occur in tandem with a vowel: semivowels follow a vowel (y is a vowel in *joey* [notice how long it is] but a semivowel in *joy* [notice how short it is]), while glides precede a vowel (y in *yes* or w in *west*). I personally think of these sounds as being like "hammering on" or "pulling off" a guitar chord.

### Funny business you can figure about later

Combining the above three things gives you the basic recipe for a given sound, called the "phonemic" representation. You can think of these "phonemic" representations as being kind of like headwords—the only form you'll see in the dictionary is "eat", but, in practice, "eat" actually has several forms: eats, eating, ate, eaten.

When we want to show these more specific "other" forms of a specific sound, we can use what are called [diacritic markers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet#Diacritics_and_prosodic_notation) to show things like [(lip) roundedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundedness) and [tongue shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue_shape). While not always needed, this information can be helpful because one basic sound may have multiple possible realizations in another language, called [allophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone).

- **Phonemic transcriptions** use forward slashes: /p/ is the "basic" P sound
- **Phonetic transcriptions** use brackets: [P^h] refers to a P pronounced with a lot of expelled air (compare the P in *pot* vs the one in *spot*)
