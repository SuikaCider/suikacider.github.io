> *There's a lot of information on this page. You do not need to memorize any of it to read my pronunciation guides. Each page of the main document has been written assuming that you don't know anything about phonetics beyond what I explicitly tell you.*
 {: .prompt-info }

Everything I'm about to tell you builds off of a simple fact: sound is an inherently physical phenomenon.

Just as [blowing into a nearly-full bottle will result in a high-pitched whistle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl4zGRSYqkE), every single sound you make is the result of air escaping your mouth (and/or nose) in a specific way. This in mind, we could say that sounds have "recipes": just as a cake is (basically) the result of flour, sugar, and eggs, a T sound is (basically) the result of placing your tongue in a specific place and expelling air from your mouth without letting your vocal chords vibrate.

In the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) (IPA), the official "recipe" for /t/ is "voiceless alveolar plosive". You don't need to know what means right now. I just want you to understand two things:

1. Each sound can be broken down into a series of concrete movements/actions within your speech organ
2. Recipes are somewhat open to interpretation: just as one chef might use more or less sugar for their signature cake, the standard French /t/ sound isn't quite the same as the standard English /t/ sound

This in mind, in each of my pronunciation guides, I am basically contrasting English's IPA with another language's IPA for you.

Talking about sounds in this way might seem weird at first, but doing so comes with three major benefits:

1. **Consistency within languages**: Each sound in the IPA is associated with a specific name and symbol — there's no funny business like GH sounding one way in *tough*, another in *ghost*, and another still in *neighbor*.
2. **Consistency between languages**: IPA symbols are quite consistent across languages — there's no funny business like English's C sounding like K or S but Pinyin's C sounding like "ts"
3. **Clarity of instruction**: Each IPA symbol's name is a concrete "recipe" that will tell you (almost) step-by-step how to pronounce a given sound

That out of the way:

## The "recipes" of consonants
Now that the scene is set, we're ready to talk about consonants. Whether you're speaking Cantonese or Klingon, every consonant boils down to the same three basic things:

1. **Place of articulation** → loosely speaking, which part of your mouth connects with which part of your mouth
2. **Manner of articulation** → what happens to air as it leaves your mouth
3. **Voicing** → place your fingers (lightly) on your neck, then say *shhhh* and *zhhhh* out loud

### Funny business you can figure about later

Combining the above three things gives you the basic recipe for a given sound, called the "phonemic" representation. You can think of these "phonemic" representations as being kind of like headwords—the only form you'll see in the dictionary is "eat", but, in practice, "eat" actually has several forms: eats, eating, ate, eaten.

When we want to show these more specific "other" forms of a specific sound, we can use what are called [diacritic markers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet#Diacritics_and_prosodic_notation) to show things like [(lip) roundedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundedness) and [tongue shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue_shape). While not always needed, this information can be helpful because one basic sound may have multiple possible realizations in another language, called [allophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone).

- **Phonemic transcriptions** use forward slashes: /p/ is the "basic" P sound
- **Phonetic transcriptions** use brackets: [P^h^] refers to a P pronounced with a lot of expelled air (compare the P in *pot* vs the one in *spot*)
