Hi! If you don't know anything about pronunciation, or if my dedicated pronunciation pages look at bit scary, here's where you should start.

## What we'll cover in this 101 series:

I've written all of my "guides" with the assumption that readers know nothing about phonetics, but your life will be easier if you skim the following before diving into a particular language's pronunciation guide.

- [1. Phonetics, or the biomechanics of pronunciation](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/Phonetics-Biomechanics-of-Pronunciation/)
- [2. Suprasegmentals, or the melody behind the accent](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/Suprasegmentals-the-melody-of-an-accent/)
- [3. How to practice pronunciation](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/How-to-Practice-Pronunciation/)
- [4. How good of an accent do you need, anyway?](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/how-good-of-an-accent-do-you-need/)


## What we'll cover in each language's pronunciation guide

As discussed in post 1 above, sounds are kind of like lego constructions: put blocks A B and C together in a particular order and you get a particular sound. It's helpful to become familiar with those "lego blocks" because there are very, very few sounds that are actually completely foreign. More often than not, they're simply new arrangements of familiar parts.

In each guide, I simply start with what will be familiar for (General American) English speakers and then walk through the specific steps you need to take to get from [English sound] to [foreign sound].

I organize this information as follows:
- Sounds that are shared between English and [other language]
- Sounds that are similar between English and [other language], but need to be tweaked
- Sounds that only exist in [other language], so English speakers should learn
- Sounds that only exist in English, so you should avoid them when speaking [other language]


## Why I've chosen to organize my pronunciation guides this way
I find that most pronunciation guides on the internet fall into one of two categories:

- *Overly generic* → Sounds are described as being *"roughly like English's _ _ _ "*. This is helpful in a pinch, but it lacks the concrete details you need to learn to correctly make the sound in question.

- *Overly complex* → The information is concrete and accurate, but the author assumed that only other linguists/nerds would be interested in this content, so they also assume that you know what things like *retroflex (concave apical)* mean. Plus, academic papers and discussion between linguistics aren't necessarily intended to be instructional.

And I basically want to create a happy medium between those two extremes.

My explanations will be accurate and technical, but above all they will be  *practical*. I'll give you the concrete steps you need to take to get from sound A to sound B, but I won't assume that you are coming into my writing with any background knowledge about pronunciation.

So, anyway, let's get started: [What pronunciation is, bio-mechanically](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/What-Pronunciation-Is-Biomechanically/)
