I've created this page because I think most pronunciation guides on the internet fall into one of two categories:

- Overly generic — Sounds are described as being "roughly like English's _ _ _ ", and that lacks the information you need to actually fix your pronunciation

- Overly complex — The information is accurate, but you basically need a degree in phonology to find and understand it

And I want to strike a happy medium between those two extremes. My explanations will be accurate and technical, but practical. I'll cover exactly how two sounds differ and what you need to do, bio-mechanically, to make a particular French sound... but I won't assume that you know anything about phonetics.
