I've created this page because I think most pronunciation guides on the internet fall into one of two categories:

- Overly generic — Sounds are described as being "roughly like English's ___", and that lacks the information you need to actually fix your pronunciation
- Overly complex — The information is accurate, but you basically need a degree in phonology to find and understand it

And I want to strike a happy medium between those two extremes. My explanations will be accurate and technical, but practical. I'll cover exactly how two sounds differ and what you need to do, biomechanicaly, to make a particular French sound... but I won't assume that you know anything about phonetics.
