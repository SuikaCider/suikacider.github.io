> Hi! I'm [Sui](https://www.reddit.com/user/SuikaCider/), and I spend way too much time talking about language learning on Reddit. I've decided to compile some of my more "useful" brain dumps into static webpages, mostly as a means of procrastination, and this is one of those brain dumps.

This brain dump is an in-depth look at French pronunciation. We'll get into:
- [What pronunciation is, biomechanically](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/Start-Here/)
- [French consonants](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/French-Consonants-Overview/)
- [French vowels](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/French-Vowels-Overview/)
- [French intonation](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/French-Suprasegmentals/)

More specifically, each section will be organized as follows:
- Sounds that are shared between French and English
- Sounds that are similar, but require small adjustments
- Sounds that are new, and that you’ll need to learn
- English sounds that don’t exist in French, and that you should thus avoid making

I've created this page because I think most pronunciation guides on the internet fall into one of two categories:

- Overly generic — Sounds are described as being "roughly like English's ___", and that lacks the information you need to actually fix your pronunciation
- Overly complex — The information is accurate, but you basically need a degree in phonology to find and understand it

And I want to strike a happy medium between those two extremes. My explanations will be accurate and technical, but practical. I'll cover exactly how two sounds differ and what you need to do, biomechanicaly, to make a particular French sound... but I won't assume that you know anything about phonetics.
