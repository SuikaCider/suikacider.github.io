> *Hi! I'm [Sui](https://www.reddit.com/user/SuikaCider/), and I spend way too much time talking about language learning on Reddit. I've decided to compile some of my more "useful" brain dumps into static webpages, mostly as a means of procrastination, and this is one of those brain dumps.*

This brain dump is an in-depth look at French pronunciation. We'll get into:
- [Pronunciation 101](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/Pronunciation-101/)
- [French consonants](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/French-Consonants-Overview/)
- [French vowels](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/French-Vowels-Overview/)
- [French intonation](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/French-Suprasegmentals/)

More specifically, each section will be organized as follows:
- Sounds that are shared between French and English
- Sounds that are similar, but require small adjustments
- Sounds that are new, and that you’ll thus need to learn
- English sounds that don’t exist in French, and that you should thus avoid making

You can start wherever you want, but I recommend at least peeking at the Pronunciation 101 landing page. It gets a bit more into how I've organized this information and why I've done so that way, and also contains background information that might help you get more out of the more technical web pages.
