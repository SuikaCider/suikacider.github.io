> *Hi! I'm [Sui](https://www.reddit.com/user/SuikaCider/), and I spend way too much time talking about language learning on Reddit. I've decided to compile some of my more "useful" brain dumps into static webpages, mostly as a means of procrastination, and this is one of those brain dumps.*

This brain dump is an in-depth look at French pronunciation. We'll get into:
- [Pronunciation 101](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/Start-Here/)
- [French consonants](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/French-Consonants-Overview/)
- [French vowels](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/French-Vowels-Overview/)
- [French intonation](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/French-Suprasegmentals/)

More specifically, each section will be organized as follows:
- Sounds that are shared between French and English
- Sounds that are similar, but require small adjustments
- Sounds that are new, and that you’ll thus need to learn
- English sounds that don’t exist in French, and that you should thus avoid making

That out of the way:
1. If you already know about the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), you can jump right into the French sections listed above
2. If you don't know what the IPA is, or feel like you'd benefit from a Pronunciation 101 type thing, start from [*What pronunciation is, biomechanically*](https://suikacider.github.io/posts/Start-Here/).
