Hi! I haven't thought about this page yet.

Disclaimer: I am not a linguist. This is more a place where I document my journey through languages and stuff.

Languages:
- Japanese ([JLPT N1√](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test), [preparing for BJT J1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Japanese_Proficiency_Test))
- Mandarin ([Squeaking by TOCFL 4 mock tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_of_Chinese_as_a_Foreign_Language))
- Spanish ([Low B2?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) — I mostly use Spanish to read fantasy books)
- Russian ([High A2?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) — A couple thousand hours of conversation, no formal study)
- French ([A0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) — I'm goofing around with French pronunciation because I listen to a lot of French music)
- Korean ([A0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) – I'll move to Korea in a few years, and am slowly preparing for that)
